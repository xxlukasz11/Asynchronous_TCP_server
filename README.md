# Asynchronous TCP/IP server
Simple asynchronous TCP/IP server in Linux

Tcp_server is a singleton class, which provides asynchronous communication with clients. It's based on producent/consumer design pattern. One thread "produces" sockets descriptors, and puts them into thread-safe queue. Then other threads "consume" them and exchange data with clients.

To compile example program, you need CMake and C++ compiler which supports C++11 standard.

In order to run example:
 - go to build directory and type: `cmake ../example/`
 - after configuration is done, hit: `make`
 - executable will appear in `bin/` directory

# Simplified sequence of function calls

```c++
// get server instance
auto& server = Tcp_server::get_instance();

// set number of consumers threads
server.set_number_of_consumers(3);

// initialize server - bind to the port, e.t.c.
server.initialize();

// run server and consumers threads with defined handler
server.start_server( [&server](int client_socket){
  // your own code to handle the connections
  // for example:
  auto recv_msg = server.recv_data_from_client(client_socket);
  server.send_data_to_client(client_socket, "Data recieved");
} );

// in order to join threads, Tcp_server::stop_server must be called
server.join_threads();
```
